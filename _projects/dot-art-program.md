Over the past year, I have been working for the public art program at the Department of Transportation. DOT Art commissions and oversees the installation of public artwork on DOT property throughout the five boroughs and curates and manages programming at annual large-scale, car-free events including, Summer Streets and Car Free Earth Day. Over the past 12 years, since the inception of the program, DOT Art has done over 300 temporary and permanent art installations along sidewalks, walls, bridges, fences, asphalt and ferries.

Over the winter of 2018/2019, I worked on logging all 300+ projects into a spreadsheet, including all the important information, as well as site coordinates and a link to the piece’s associated flickr page. After completing this spreadsheet, I used this course to learn how to develop this map as a tool that could extend beyond the walls of DOT and into the public realm. While researching other city’s public art program, I came across a [map the city of Toronto created](https://streetart.to/) that I decided to model mine after. It is still a work in progress, but I plan to finish this project and have it ready for the public by the summer of 2019.
