This map locates the different areas which are serving the art and design sector of the country. Art and design is important in the development and growth of a society and as Qatar transitions to a knowledge economy with a strategy focusing on the advancement of STEM knowledge and skills. Bringing that focus to art and design, this map is a tool to begin representing these fields in the strategy for STEAM.

By beginning to show these spaces on a map collectively, one can see where they are located and how many in each category. One category is Museums, and these spaces are highly accessible to the public and therefore would be vital in STEAM initiatives as they already foster knowledge sharing and production within society. 

Data for this map was collected manually and can be navigated within one page, with links to most of these spaces corresponding portals.
